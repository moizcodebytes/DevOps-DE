## Create a calculator which performs add,sub,multiply,division of two numbers.

## Declaring variables and values
x = 500
y = 300

## Taking numbers and operators from user 
x = int(input("please enter the value1 :" ))
y = int(input("please enter the value2 :"))

sum = x + y
print("the sum of two numbers is " ,sum)
sub = x - y
print("the sub of two numbers is " ,sub)
product = x * y
print("the product of two numbers is " ,product)
division = x / y
print("the division of two numbers is " ,division)

### output

''' please enter the value1 :5
please enter the value2 :10
the sum of two numbers is  15
the sub of two numbers is  -5
the product of two numbers is  50
the division of two numbers is  0.5
