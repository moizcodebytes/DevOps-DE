''' Python is called an interpreted language because it executes code logic directly, line by line, without the need for a separate compilation step. 
In methods to compiled languages like C or C++, where the source code is translated into machine code before execution, 
Python code is translated into intermediate code by the Python interpreter. '''

'''python is mix of intrepreted language as it executes line by line code and compilation language as it follows factors of compilation.

Steps of compilation:
1. source code : Human readable format code with .py extenstion.
2. Lexical Analysis : Source code is break down to character tokens togeth
